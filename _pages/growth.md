Additionally, we now also have a largish group of [Affiliated Faculty](https://nlp.stanford.edu/people/).

## Students

Over the years, the number of Stanford NLP students, postdocs, and
staff has also grown. We don't have precise numbers, but the whole group had
a single digit size in its earliest years, a size in the teens till
about 2010, and then has exploded in size so that there are now over
100 current members.
